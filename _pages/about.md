I am an Electronics, Electrical and Computer Engineer by formal education, a [Mathematical Statistician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_statistics#:~:text=Mathematical%20statistics%20is%20the%20application,techniques%20for%20collecting%20statistical%20data.) & [Roboticist](https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/blog/what-does-a-roboticist-do/#:~:text=Roboticists%20are%20generally%20involved%20in,knowledge%20of%20every%20stage%2C%20however.) by action, and an [Autodidact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodidacticism) of [Medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine) & [Surgery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery#:~:text=Surgery%20is%20a%20medical%20or,to%20repair%20unwanted%20ruptured%20areas.) by passion. I am currently working with [Amazon.com, Inc.](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles) as a Research Scientist II in the [Advertising Measurement and Optimization](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/internal/search?base_query=avelloc) team. I am also a collaborating [Roboticist](https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/blog/what-does-a-roboticist-do/#:~:text=Roboticists%20are%20generally%20involved%20in,knowledge%20of%20every%20stage%2C%20however.) with the [ARMS Lab](https://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/robotics/) at [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/) working on Computational Motion Planning for Autonomous Vehicles, under the supervision of [Dr. Arpita Sinha](https://sites.google.com/iitb.ac.in/arpitasinha). I am currently pursuing a Professional Program in Genetics and Genomics with the Stanford University, School of Medicine. I recently obtained my Professional Certificate in Artificial Intelligence (with focus in Natural Language Processing, Statistical Modelling and Graph Learning) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu), School of Engineering. Prior to joining [Amazon.com, Inc.](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles), I completed my [M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://github.com/nishkeni/nishkeni.github.io/blob/master/images/MS_ECE_DegreeCertificate_NishantKeni.pdf) at [Georgia Tech, Atlanta](https://www.gatech.edu/) with a focus in Digital Signal Processing, where I was fortunate to work with [Gari Clifford](http://gdclifford.info/people/gari) and [Justin Romberg](https://jrom.ece.gatech.edu). Before that, I completed my B.Tech. in Electronics Engineering (Gold Medal) at [VJTI, Mumbai](https://www.vjti.ac.in/), where I was involved in research with Rizwan Ahmed and [Faruk Kazi](https://www.vjti.ac.in/images/coe-cnds/project/resume/kazi_sir.pdf). I am, however, still passively affiliated to the [Center of Excellence (CoE) in Complex and Non-Linear Dynamical Systems (CNDS)](https://www.vjti.ac.in/images/coe-cnds/project/index.html), VJTI.

Research Interests
======

My broad research interest lies in building Statistical Models and Algorithms which can efficiently perform Inference and Learning. My key areas of focus are in Statistical Signal Processing & Optimization, Robotics, Network Science, and Biological Modeling. Besides these, I actively self-study subjects in Medicine, Theoretical Surgery and Oncology. My prime hobby is _'Thinking'_ and I like to find algorithmic solutions to real-life problems by _'kernelling'_ them into the Mathematical World.

Get in Touch
======

As a researcher, I love to wear the hats of both a theoretician and a maker. I generally tend to minimize meetings; [here's](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) an interesting perspective on what meetings mean for makers. If there's anything you believe I can assist you with, I look forward to talking to you!
