I am an Electronics, Electrical and Computer Engineer by formal education, a [Mathematical Statistician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_statistics#:~:text=Mathematical%20statistics%20is%20the%20application,techniques%20for%20collecting%20statistical%20data.) by profession, and a budding Roboticist by passion. I am currently working with [Amazon.com, Inc.](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles) as a Data Scientist II in the [Advertising Measurement and Optimization](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/internal/search?base_query=avelloc) team, and pursuing a Professional Certification in Artificial Intelligence (with focus in Natural Language Processing, Statistical Modelling and Graph Learning) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu). I am also a collaborating Roboticist with the [ARMS Lab](https://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/robotics/) at [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/) working on Computational Motion Planning for Autonomous Vehicles under the supervision of [Dr. Arpita Sinha](https://sites.google.com/iitb.ac.in/arpitasinha). I recently completed my [M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://github.com/nishkeni/nishkeni.github.io/blob/master/images/MS_ECE_DegreeCertificate_NishantKeni.pdf) at [Georgia Tech, Atlanta](https://www.gatech.edu/) with a focus in Digital Signal Processing, where I was fortunate to work with [Gari Clifford](http://gdclifford.info/people/gari) and [Justin Romberg](https://jrom.ece.gatech.edu). Before that, I completed my B.Tech. in Electronics Engineering (Institute Gold Medal) at [VJTI, Mumbai](https://www.vjti.ac.in/), where I was involved in research with Rizwan Ahmed and [Faruk Kazi](https://www.vjti.ac.in/images/coe-cnds/project/resume/kazi_sir.pdf). I am, however, still passively affiliated to the [Center of Excellence (CoE) in Complex and Non-Linear Dynamical Systems (CNDS)](https://www.vjti.ac.in/images/coe-cnds/project/index.html), VJTI.

Research Interests
======

My broad research interest lies in building Statistical Models and Algorithms which can efficiently perform Inference and Learning. My key areas of focus are in Statistical Modelling, Network Science, Robotics and Optimization. My prime hobby is _'Thinking'_ and I like to find algorithmic solutions to real-life problems by _'kernelling'_ them into the Mathematical World. I also like to think about the fusion of Machine Learning and Game Theory, as these disciplines model the most supreme agents we live with!

Get in Touch
======

As a background context, I am <i>aggressively</i> protective of my time, as I believe we all should be. As a researcher, I love to wear the hats of both a theoretician and a maker. [Here's](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) an interesting perspective on what meetings mean for makers. 

If there's anything you believe I can assist you with, I am looking forward to talking to you! If you want to chat with me, please consider e-mailing me first for context, and then using [this](https://calendly.com/nishant-keni) to find a time that works best for you.
