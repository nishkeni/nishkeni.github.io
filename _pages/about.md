I am an Electrical, Electronics and Computer Engineer by formal education, an [Applied Mathematician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mathematics#:~:text=Applied%20mathematics%20is%20the%20application,mathematical%20science%20and%20specialized%20knowledge.) & Autonomous Roboticist by action, and a [Precision Medicinist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_medicine) _(Neuro-Oncology)_ by passion. I am working with [Amazon.com, Inc.](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles) as a Research Scientist II in the [Advertising Measurement and Optimization](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/internal/search?base_query=avelloc) team where I work on challenges in _Causal Inference, Signal Processing & Optimization_. In parallel, I am pursuing a Post-Graduate Certificate in Robotics and Mechatronics at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in/). Concurrently, I am also pursuing Certification Programs in Medicine at [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/) and [Stanford Medicine](https://med.stanford.edu/) specializing in Precision Oncology and Cancer Genomics. 

In 2021, I obtained my Professional Certificate in Artificial Intelligence (_with a focus in Natural Language Processing, Statistical Modelling and Graph Learning_) from [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu), School of Engineering. Prior to joining [Amazon.com, Inc.](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles), I completed my [M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://github.com/nishkeni/nishkeni.github.io/blob/master/images/MS_ECE_DegreeCertificate_NishantKeni.pdf) at [Georgia Tech, Atlanta](https://www.gatech.edu/) with a focus in Digital Signal Processing, where I was fortunate to work with [Gari Clifford](http://gdclifford.info/people/gari) and [Justin Romberg](https://jrom.ece.gatech.edu). Before that, I completed my B.Tech. in Electronics Engineering (Gold Medal) at [VJTI, Mumbai](https://www.vjti.ac.in/), where I was involved in research with Rizwan Ahmed and [Faruk Kazi](https://www.vjti.ac.in/images/coe-cnds/project/resume/kazi_sir.pdf).

Research Interests
======

My broad research interest lies in building Statistical Models and Algorithms which can efficiently perform Inference, Optimization and Learning. My key areas of focus are in Robot Motion Planning & Autonomous Control, Probabilistic Decision-Making, Systems Biology and Signal Processing. Besides these, I actively self-study subjects in Theoretical Surgery & Internal Medicine (Neurology, Cardiology). My prime hobby is _'Thinking'_ and I like to find algorithmic solutions to real-life problems by _'kernelling'_ them into the Mathematical World.

Get in Touch
======

As a researcher, I love to wear the hats of both a theoretician and a maker. I generally tend to minimize meetings; [here's](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) an interesting perspective on what meetings mean for makers. If there's anything you believe I can assist you with, I look forward to talking to you! 

If you want to chat with me, please use [this](https://calendly.com/nishant-keni) to find a time that works best for you.
