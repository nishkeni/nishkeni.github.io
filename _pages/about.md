I am an Electronics, Electrical and Computer Engineer by formal education, an Applied Mathematician _(with a focus in Statistics & Robotics)_ by action, and a Medicinist _(with a focus in Theoretical Surgery, Oncology, Genetics & Genomics)_ by passion. I am currently a Research Scientist II in the [Advertising Measurement and Optimization](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/internal/search?base_query=avelloc) team at [Amazon.com, Inc.](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles) where I work on challenges in _Causal Inference, Signal Processing & Optimization_. In parallel, I am pursuing a Professional Program in Genetics and Genomics at the Stanford University, [School of Medicine](https://med.stanford.edu/genetics.html). I will also concurrently be starting my Certification Program on the Fundamentals of Medicine at [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/) in June 2022!

I recently obtained my Professional Certificate in Artificial Intelligence _(with a focus in Natural Language Processing, Statistical Modelling and Graph Learning)_ at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu), School of Engineering. Prior to joining [Amazon.com, Inc.](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles), I completed my [M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://github.com/nishkeni/nishkeni.github.io/blob/master/images/MS_ECE_DegreeCertificate_NishantKeni.pdf) at [Georgia Tech, Atlanta](https://www.gatech.edu/) with a focus in Digital Signal Processing, where I was fortunate to work with [Gari Clifford](http://gdclifford.info/people/gari) and [Justin Romberg](https://jrom.ece.gatech.edu). Before that, I completed my B.Tech. in Electronics Engineering (Gold Medal) at [VJTI, Mumbai](https://www.vjti.ac.in/), where I was involved in research with Rizwan Ahmed and [Faruk Kazi](https://www.vjti.ac.in/images/coe-cnds/project/resume/kazi_sir.pdf). I am, however, still passively affiliated to the [Center of Excellence (CoE) in Complex and Non-Linear Dynamical Systems (CNDS)](https://www.vjti.ac.in/images/coe-cnds/project/index.html), VJTI.

Research Interests
======

My broad research interest lies in building Statistical Models and Algorithms which can efficiently perform Inference and Learning. My key areas of focus are in Statistical Signal Processing & Optimization, Robotics, Network Science, and Biological Modeling. Besides these, I actively self-study subjects in Medicine, Theoretical Surgery and Oncology. My prime hobby is _'Thinking'_ and I like to find algorithmic solutions to real-life problems by _'kernelling'_ them into the Mathematical World.

Get in Touch
======

As a researcher, I love to wear the hats of both a theoretician and a maker. I generally tend to minimize meetings; [here's](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) an interesting perspective on what meetings mean for makers. If there's anything you believe I can assist you with, I look forward to talking to you!
