I am an Electronics, Electrical and Computer Engineer by formal education, an [Engineering Statistician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_statistics) by profession, and a budding Computational Bioinformatician by passion. I am currently working with [Amazon.com, Inc.](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles) as a Data Scientist II in the [Global Talent Management Science](https://amazon.jobs/en/internal/search?base_query=HR+GTM) team, and pursuing a Professional Certification in Artificial Intelligence (with focus in Natural Language Processing & Understanding, and Theoretical Artificial Intelligence). I recently completed my [M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://github.com/nishkeni/nishkeni.github.io/blob/master/images/MS_ECE_DegreeCertificate_NishantKeni.pdf) at [Georgia Tech, Atlanta](https://www.gatech.edu/) with specialization in Digital Signal Processing, where I was fortunate to work with [Gari Clifford](http://gdclifford.info/people/gari) and [Justin Romberg](https://jrom.ece.gatech.edu). Before that, I completed my B.Tech. in Electronics Engineering (Institute Gold Medal) from [VJTI, Mumbai](https://www.vjti.ac.in/), where I was involved in research with Rizwan Ahmed and [Faruk Kazi](https://www.vjti.ac.in/images/coe-cnds/project/resume/kazi_sir.pdf). I am, however, still passively affiliated to the [Center of Excellence (CoE) in Complex and Non-Linear Dynamical Systems (CNDS)](https://www.vjti.ac.in/images/coe-cnds/project/index.html), VJTI.

Research Interests
======

My broad research interest lies in building Statistical Models and Algorithms which can efficiently perform Inference and Learning. My key areas of focus are in  Probabilistic Robotics, Network Science, Statistical Signal Processing and Bioinformatics. My prime hobby is _'Thinking'_ and I like to find algorithmic solutions to real-life problems by _'kernelling'_ them into a Mathematical World. I also like to think about the fusion of Machine Learning and Game Theory, as these disciplines model the most supreme agents we live with; the former created by Humans while the later created by Biological Science!

Get in Touch
======

As a background context, I am <i>aggressively</i> protective of my time, as I believe we all should be. Aas a researhcer, I love to wear the hats of both a theoretician and a maker. [Here's](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) an interesting perspective on why disruptions are corrosive to a maker's schedule. 

If there's anything you believe I can assist you with, I am looking forward to talking to you! If you want to chat with me, please consider e-mailing me first for context, and then using [this](https://calendly.com/nishant-keni) to find a time that works best for you.
